#  TurboTube
## An application (Site Web) that can be utilized to download a video (mp4) or audio (mp3) from youtube .
##### To describe my project I use the CAR method (C : Chalenge , A : Action , R : Result)
###### C : Developing an application that can download video or audio from YouTube is the challenge. I made the decision to develop this application because I have many difficulties downloading it, I am frightened of being hacked, and there are many ads. Also, my task in stage is to integrate DevOps into this idea.
###### A : search for and find the idea of the project, self-study to understand the basis of Devops, containerization, creation and manipulation of image and container in Docker, also understand CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery or deployment), the difference between Jenkins and Gitlab, learning Jenkins and the difference between Freestyle Project , Multibranch Pipleline and Pipleline Project , as well as the structure and how to encode a Jenkinsfile(Pipeline), use and integrate libraries like pytube, pathlib, ... in Flask . 
###### R : I was very pleased with the results, as I had a new challenge in DevOps and gained many new technologies, as well as improving my skills in search ..
